Of these 211,326 mentions, 565 of them are gestational diabetes, 21,531 are Type 1 diabetes and 41,139 are Type 2 diabetes. I don't trust those numbers because in my test dataset it guessed less than 2/3 of the types correctly. Additionally, 8,842 of those mentions are negated, 6,140 are hypothetical and 3,468 are in a person other than the patient. Again, I think these numbers are underestimates, just like the types. \n",
